O(n!)
O(n^2) -> == selection sort and quicksort (worst case)
O(n log n) -> == merge sort and quicksort (best case)
O(n) -> == linear search (number of elements = number of operations) /
O(log n) -> == binary search and quicksort


n = number of elements

BIG O Notation

- Tells you number of times an operation is performed.
- Doesn´t describe duration of operation.
- A usefull tool for quickly describing how the run time of an algorithm increases as the data set it´s operating on gets really, really big.
